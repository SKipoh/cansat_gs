# CANsat Ground Station Arduino

The code in this repo is only to be used for a ground station "repeater" arduino if you don't have a USB-to-Serial adapter for the APC220

All this code does is read in the data from the APC220 and then write it over the hardware serial port to the host computer

## How to use this code
- Load the project into PlatformIO
- Check build configuration is correct for your MCU
- Check it builds correctly
- Upload to arduino
